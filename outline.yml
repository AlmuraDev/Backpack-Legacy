# Backpack Technical Details
# - All backpacks (files) are loaded at server start (and never again).
# - All backpacks are saved after EACH ACTION (and not on window close).
# - For any player which does not have a Backpack within the backend will have their file deleted. This can only happen if the admin or another with permission runs the backpack remove command
